# Personalized Product Recommendation System with PySpark
## 1. Background
- Recommendation systems have become an essential component of e-commerce platforms, online services, and mobile applications, especially in the context of increasingly rich and diverse user data. These systems not only provide product recommendations but also utilize complex algorithms to personalize the user experience, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and improving conversion rates. Leading companies like Amazon, Netflix, and Spotify have demonstrated the power of personalized recommendation systems in establishing deep connections with users while simultaneously driving revenue growth and customer retention.

- While traditional recommendation methods, such as Collaborative Filtering and Content-based Filtering, are still widely used, newer technologies like machine learning and big data are gradually replacing older approaches to deliver more accurate and effective results. The processing of vast amounts of data, including user behavior, product reviews, and transaction records, has become a significant challenge for companies. Consequently, the adoption of powerful data processing tools like Apache Spark and its PySpark library has emerged as an effective solution for handling and analyzing large-scale data.

- Thus, researching and developing a personalized product recommendation system using PySpark not only addresses market demands but also delivers practical value to businesses, contributing to the advancement of cutting-edge technologies in big data analytics and machine learning.
